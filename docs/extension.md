# Extending Jenkins

Developing plugins is valuable alone but isn't necessary to benefit from the resources to do so:
- Learn the internals of Jenkins
- Which can disambiguate confusing terminology like project/job/pipeline/build/etc
  - And we all know code tells the true state of reality so it can clear up things like outdated documentation and inconsistent UI labeling.

## Extension Points

- [Extensions Index](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/) outlines extension points for
  - [`Jenkins Core`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/jenkins-core/)
  - and popular plugins such as the [pipeline-model-definition](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/pipeline-model-definition/)
